Profitable Semi-Absentee Owned SaaS Company,"Grand Prairie, TX (Dallas County) (Relocatable)",N/A,"$218,446","$897,070","$143,446",1999,N/A,"$25,500","We are pleased to announce the availability for sale of this 24 year-old semi-absentee operated, consistently profitable SaaS (software as a service) Company, which focuses on the legal case management space. This company has returned 20%+ of its revenues as cash flow over the past four years and has consistently generated over $200K in cash flow on revenues of $850K-900K and features 85%-90% in recurring revenues across its long standing and loyal customer base. Due to increased business at two of its largest clients, through June of 2023, the company has generated revenues of $557K and cash flow of $173K, which suggests a $1.2M revenue run rate and SDE in excess of $350K. Its owner has had chronic health issues and has been forced to run the company as an absentee owner, investing only about 20 hours per week in the company, over the past several years. This company is positioned within the e-Discovery Consulting Services space in the US. This industry provides e-discovery services, usually for software and systems integration, that search, locate and secure data to use as evidence in court. Industry operators provide e-discovery consulting services, including collecting, processing and reviewing data, to end users like law firms, corporations, hospitals and government agencies. This industry excludes e-discovery software publishing, although some consulting firms may also develop their own software.(IBISWorld).This company boasts long term customer relationships, with high retention rates, a highly talented and well tenured employee pool.  Our analogy of this company is that it is a high performance Indy Car, which has been running on idle for the past few years, and it is simply waiting on a new driver (owner) to reach its potential. The fact that this company has used a work-from-home model, for 100% of its employees, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests that it can be operated from anywhere in the world as it does not occupy any corporate facilities and that all of its employees work from home, which provides the buyer with maximum operational flexibility.We believe that the possibilities for this company are almost endless and that it could grow considerably with adequate investment levels of advertising and sales as it has spent less than $3,000 on advertising in the past two years and it has no sales persons. The owner is committed to provide whatever level of training and transitional support to the buyer and for a mutually agreeable duration. No list price is provided as this company will be sold to the highest bidder and multiples for SaaS companies can vary widely based on a particular buyer and its fit for that buyer's purposes. According to reputable third party sources, SaaS businesses are generally valued on a multiple of their revenue - in most cases, the projected revenue for the next 12 months. Revenue multiples are a shorthand valuation framework. Given that most software companies are not profitable, or not generating meaningful FCF (Free Cash Flow), it’s the only metric to compare the entire industry against. Even a DCF (discounted cash flow) is riddled with long term assumptions. The promise of SaaS is that growth in the early years leads to profits in the mature years.","Grand Prairie, TX",7,Included in asking price,Home based. (Home Based),"This company enjoys high customer retention, recurring revenues, and well tenured employees and it appears to be well positioned against its competitors within the legal case management space.","We believe that considerable growth opportunities exist for this company under the right leadership.
