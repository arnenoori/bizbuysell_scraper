It is also mainly one of their top high earning service. That is because it takes very little time for them to administer. On average Invisalign costs a patient about $6,000 dollars.What is the business?Generating Invisalign leads for Orthodontists.How do I generate leads?We use Facebook ads to generate leads which are automatically sent to the Orthodontist. Simply copy and paste our Facebook ads targeting and ad copy.How do I make money?After we contact Orthodontists which we find on LinkedIn (best method) when starting; we charge $450/month. $150 of that goes to ad spend. You profit $300/month. Keeping the price low at the beginning allows it to be enticing for most Orthodontists. Over time increase the fee, which means a higher ad spend, which means more leads.How do we run Facebook ads?The real skill is in the Facebook ads which we will teach you in an included video and also for one month after your purchase. This is such an easy and hands off business to run, but you must have the basics in place which we teach you and guide you for one full month. Copy and paste, rinse and repeat. With over 60,000 Orthodontists between Canada and the USA, we could never service them all.How many leads can you generate per month?This all depends on demographic and city and the targeting and other factors. Generally though the $150/mth ad spend can generate about 25+ leads a month. Orthodontists can increase the ad spend and get a lot more. They can spend say $1K/mth and be able to get about 240 leads a month.What am I buying?We are showing you step by step over the shoulder how our agency finds clients (Orthodontists) and how we run Facebook ads. We show you how we automatically send the leads to clients and how to automatically get paid straight to your square account or PayPal.Our staff will dedicate up to one full month of support via Phone, Text, Skype or Zoom. Our goal is simply to duplicate what we have done. Our goal is to have you succeed as we have and be able to scale by way of referrals from current clients. Nothing more and nothing less.There are so many cities and states it would be next to impossible to serve them all. Here is where you come in.How many clients can I get?You can easily get 5 clients to work with in less than 2 months. Which is more than you will need to build this business. After your first client or two you scale by asking for referrals. Again, Orthodontists know and hang out with other Orthodontists.This is a very high margin type business. For every dollar spent in Facebook ads you will cashflow $2.For now, we are accepting seven (7) individuals. This will enable us to give our full attention for the full month so that you are succeeding as soon as possible.You must have a laptop or computer and be comfortable using one. You must also be willing to create a LinkedIn account and secondary have a Facebook account. A beautiful done website will also be included so you hit the ground running.This is a business as any other so you must be willing to invest the time and patience and also be coach-able and teachable.

It is also mainly one of their top high earning service. That is because it takes very little time for them to administer. On average Invisalign costs a patient about $6,000 dollars.What is the business?Generating Invisalign leads for Orthodontists.How do I generate leads?We use Facebook ads to generate leads which are automatically sent to the Orthodontist. Simply copy and paste our Facebook ads targeting and ad copy.How do I make money?After we contact Orthodontists which we find on LinkedIn (best method) when starting; we charge $450/month. $150 of that goes to ad spend. You profit $300/month. Keeping the price low at the beginning allows it to be enticing for most Orthodontists. Over time increase the fee, which means a higher ad spend, which means more leads.How do we run Facebook ads?The real skill is in the Facebook ads which we will teach you in an included video and also for one month after your purchase. This is such an easy and hands off business to run, but you must have the basics in place which we teach you and guide you for one full month. Copy and paste, rinse and repeat. With over 60,000 Orthodontists between Canada and the USA, we could never service them all.How many leads can you generate per month?This all depends on demographic and city and the targeting and other factors. Generally though the $150/mth ad spend can generate about 25+ leads a month. Orthodontists can increase the ad spend and get a lot more. They can spend say $1K/mth and be able to get about 240 leads a month.What am I buying?We are showing you step by step over the shoulder how our agency finds clients (Orthodontists) and how we run Facebook ads. We show you how we automatically send the leads to clients and how to automatically get paid straight to your square account or PayPal.Our staff will dedicate up to one full month of support via Phone, Text, Skype or Zoom. Our goal is simply to duplicate what we have done. Our goal is to have you succeed as we have and be able to scale by way of referrals from current clients. Nothing more and nothing less.There are so many cities and states it would be next to impossible to serve them all. Here is where you come in.How many clients can I get?You can easily get 5 clients to work with in less than 2 months. Which is more than you will need to build this business. After your first client or two you scale by asking for referrals. Again, Orthodontists know and hang out with other Orthodontists.This is a very high margin type business. For every dollar spent in Facebook ads you will cashflow $2.For now, we are accepting seven (7) individuals. This will enable us to give our full attention for the full month so that you are succeeding as soon as possible.You must have a laptop or computer and be comfortable using one. You must also be willing to create a LinkedIn account and secondary have a Facebook account. A beautiful done website will also be included so you hit the ground running.This is a business as any other so you must be willing to invest the time and patience and also be coach-able and teachable.

In 1994, this company began studying the root causes behind why typical commercial office relocation projects were unsuccessful. The findings indicated that clients did not have the tools to help them clearly understand or manage their deadlines, deliverables, and dollars. This resulted in cost overruns, unplanned delays, disruption to the core business and decreased staff morale. In early 2002, this company developed and launched a software package designed specifically to educate clients and give clients an electronic playbook to help assist them when planning an office move. This software included best practices, lessons learned and templates that could be downloaded and edited. This resulted in on-time moves, improved budgeting and happy clients providing referrals and repeat business. Over the past 29 years, this business has won and successfully performed more than 10,000,000 square feet of government, legal, financial, technology, educational, office, medical, non-profit, and industrial projects. The client list includes some of the most successful companies in the world. Project scopes of work provided include owner representation, project management and relocation management services for facilities ranging in size from 3,000 square feet up to 950,000 square feet. Project locations have included California, Colorado, Florida, and New York. Historically, the key to this successful business has been a combination of the software and the ability to provide the consulting services required to support each client’s unique needs. However, the key to winning new work has been the development of the software. Sixteen (16) icons house approximately 400 activities and guide clients through each phase of their project.

The company began franchising in 1983 with the promise of ice cream and yogurt 100% fresh-made from local ingredients. Other franchises use canned ice cream. That's not the ""high-quality, come-back-delicious flavor"" you'll get every time you visit Marble Slab Creamery. We take too much pride in our frozen treats to serve anything from a can. In addition to our super-premium homemade ice cream, we hand-roll and freshly bake from scratch our signature waffle cones. Plus, there's that free unlimited mix-in philosophy that keeps guests happy and returning for loyalty card points! The seller built this Harris county franchise from the ground up 17 years ago. Throughout that time, business has been steady. Most years have grossed $240,000 or more in revenue. Revenue for 2020 decreased due to pandemic restrictions, but the business kept above breakeven. The seller never had to put money into the business. Business bounced back in 2021 with revenue of $225,000. Business rebounded fully in 2022 to pre-pandemic revenues of $240,000. And this is without doing any real marketing! This Marble Slab Creamery is located in Harris County near Hwy 45 and Sam Houston Tollway in a destination retail district. It's a very successful area with new high casual dining restaurants and special occasion spots that are generating good foot traffic. Ice cream is a seasonal business and as winter slows, the seller cuts back on hours to work just 3 days a week. The highly trained staff of 2FT, 2 PT employees run the business with limited oversight. There is one long-time employee who handles day-to-day operations and could easily be groomed to be GM. This established shop has customers & produces cash flow for the buyer on DAY 1! Plus the price is lower than the $325,000 it takes to build-out a new store! ACT NOW!

> Offer delivery through Door Dash, Uber, Postmates, etc., which can increase sales up to 20%.

This might be it.This company makes bait for lobster and crab traps, and they make it from cowhide.Why cowhide instead of the usual fish-based bait?•	It lasts far longer in the trap. It can last 2 weeks and up to 8 weeks in very cold water, where fish bait can be gone in a day or two. •	It’s very easy to transport in 5-gallon buckets.  No hauling big totes of fish bait!•	It’s cleaner and easier to handle than fish.•	The company provides de-haired cowhide for Maine, haired for other markets.One 5-gallon bucket contains about 80 pieces of bait. With one piece of bait per trap, that one bucket is enough for an average lobsterman’s daily trip. If he has to pull his traps every few days to check his bait, he can make fewer trips with cowhide bait because it lasts longer. That cuts down on the number of trips, reduces fuel costs and wear and tear on the boat – and in the colder months, fewer trips means fewer frozen fingers.That’s a compelling story that should impress any lobsterman!The company sells direct to customers across the US and Canada, but never undercuts their dealers.They deliver to dealers from Downeast Maine to Cape May, NJ.Growth Opportunities:  The 75-year-old seller has slowed way down.

"This Clinic Netted $406,752 Its 1st Yr Starting w/No Patients!",Florida,"$897,700","$406,752","$1,218,000",N/A,2021,Included in asking price,"$100,000","NOTE: There has been a high response rate to this ad by entrepreneurs without medical industry experience. This clinic's sale is now reserved for physicians licensed in Florida who accept insurance and are crushed by low collections and uncontrollable A/R. Or physicians who just want to expand to add very profitable services by buying an established clinic. This clinic, whether it remains in its current location or is moved to yours (or both), will generate COLLECTIONS above $1 million with just 140 patients a year. My restriction to sell only to a physician is not a knock on entrepreneurs without medical experience, that's what I am.In the State of Florida, it is just infinitely easier to purchase this exceptional clinic if you are a licensed physician.  Everything comes with this sale: Brand name, website, 100 real patient testimonial videos all spoken from the heart, a seasoned wonderful staff, and much more. You have instant credibility, and you can build as many of these money-makers as you'd like.This clinic has an average case value in COLLECTIONS (not charges) of $7,439. I pay an average of $901 in advertising costs to get a patient in the door, and still make a bundle.THE BREAKTHROUGH:I wound up creating a game-changing system that got my claims paid. This is why I believe my first year's $406,752 could double in Year 2. I have perfected getting paid predictably by fine-tuning my process. I will teach you how to get paid like me.THIS FLORIDA CLINIC SHOULD BE PURCHASED BY A FLORIDA PHYSICIAN WITH COMMERCIAL INSURANCE CONTRACTS:While I could've opened my clinic anywhere in the country, I chose Florida. In Florida, the easiest buyer for this clinic is a Florida-licensed physician. Especially a family practice physician. A physician already credentialed with the major insurance payors (like UHC, Aetna, Cigna, BCBS, Humana, etc.) 90% of my Patients use Medicare and/or other commercial insurance plans for their treatment.As I've mentioned, I am a non-medical entrepreneur and I built, operate, and own this clinic. It is more challenging if you are not a Florida physician. But I did it.A Florida family practice physician who is being strangled by healthcare insurance companies will love this business. A physician who would like to own a high-profit treatment clinic and serve our older Patient population. If you are my buyer, I'll show you how to get paid without the hassles.QUESTION: If it's such a good business and could net nearly $800,000 in the next 12 months it’s open, why would I sell? Because I have a bigger opportunity.

ASSETS: The biggest asset of this clinic is the patent-pending high-ticket, 7-week, 13-visit treatment plan that works! Patients are never rushed. You get to know them personally in a way no other insurance-paid medical clinic has the time or inclination to duplicate. We make it fun to come to us.",Our niche is pain management for osteoarthritis of the joints. We deliver 5-Star hospitality-style care for Medicare and commercial insurance-paid Patients.

Most clinics that accept insurance have no profit margin to provide our level of obsessive Patient care.,"GROWTH:  Move to a larger square foot facility with more senior-centric services wrapped around a community theme where Patients often stop to socialize with staff and other Patients; and (2) open more small clinics like this one.

CONS:  This business doesn't work without Medicare and commercial insurance payors like Aetna, United Healthcare, BCBS, Humana, Cigna, etc. These insurance payors use aggressive methods/tactics to marginalize medical clinic revenues and make it hard to get paid. My denial and appeals process ensures payment.","$400,000 Seller Financing subject to experience and financials of Buyer.","Buyer will be provided training onsite for 2 weeks, and remote training for six months.

Each of these brands is growing and operate multi-channel (70% of sales are Direct to Consumer via their branded websites, and 30% are generated via Amazon). They offer a wide range of consumable, high-quality products designed for repeatable purchases, making for consistent revenue streams across the board. The company has design and utility patents pending, which increases the value of the overall portfolio. And with a 40% Combined Repeat Order Rate, the company has proven that its products are well-received and very sticky with consumers.This valuable three-in-one deal provides the opportunity for the buyer to purchase several thriving eCommerce Brands across different verticals. Their common link is their sustainability and eco-friendly messaging, which has given them a significant edge in a market where more consumers are becoming concerned about the environment by the day. The company consists of an eco-friendly pest control solutions provider, a storefront that sells effective and accessibly priced air ionization devices, and a brand that specializes in sustainable cleaning solutions. They all hold a strong appeal for consumers who want to support the environment without breaking the bank, while still providing effective results that keep them consistently coming back for more.The company has 76 SKUs spread across their brands, which are sourced from 3 trusted key suppliers to bring them a combined Average Order Value of $67.55. They have a Combined Repeat Customer Rate of 41.19%, which, alongside a strong Customer Lifetime Value across the board, reflects how the company has used their sustainable nature to keep their customers coming back for refills and new purchases. Their marketing campaign has also proven to be successful in bringing in customers, to begin with, as shown by their combined average monthly user rate of nearly 3.5 million, and over 2.02 million active email contacts.They have already taken steps to pursue different scale opportunities, including expanding their marketing campaign into new social media platforms, building up an email marketing campaign, and even pursuing retail sales to make their products far more accessible. They have also set up Amazon storefronts, which will give the buyer a great method of pursuing international expansion in the future. The buyer can also increase sales by expanding the brands’ product lines with curated additions, making for an excellent package deal that’s ripe with potential.The first brand in the lineup is an eCommerce business dedicated to providing plant-based solutions to a common problem that consumers everywhere struggle with - pests. Their products, which lack the harsh chemicals or offensive odors that many other pest-control solutions suffer from, use natural ingredients and rechargeable, solar-powered devices to handle pests. Whether a customer is dealing with mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, roaches, or any other troublesome insect, they can easily find an answer that is both family and pet friendly.The second brand centers around offering eco-conscious cleaning solutions that combine high performance and sustainability. Their products make it possible for customers to wash their laundry, store trash, and clean their kitchens and bathrooms without, much like the pest-control brand, relying on harsh chemicals to do the job. Many of their products are also compostable and/or reusable, which cuts down on plastic waste and keeps their customers coming back for more.Last, but most certainly not least, is the company’s third brand, dedicated to effective and accessibly priced air ionization devices. Customers can breathe easy with the knowledge that their air will be filtered with innovative and eco-friendly designs, without having to break the bank to purchase them.This Company is Represented by:WebsiteClosers.comTech, Internet & eCommerce Business BrokersWC 3061",https://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/ecommerce-company-3-scaling-brands-eco-friendly-products/2113739/?d=undefined

Projected forecast for mature franchise locations is estimated to be $950,000 gross per year in accordance to the FDD.

They have a full-service rental and repair facility for snowboards, skiing equipment and other outdoor equipment as well. They also are the general sports headquarters for Baseball, Softball, Football, Soccer, Basketball, Volleyball, and other sporting items. They have a large selection of various sports equipment, and one of the widest selections of athletic shoes in the county. They are operating out of 2 locations - one in Northern California and one in Southern Oregon, with the Southern Oregon location starting in the fall of 2005. They have a rental income as well for snowboards, skiing equipment and other outdoor equipment and apparel. From the Southern Oregon location, they can do customized embroidery and screen printing that services both locations for customized clothing needs. Both locations are centrally located to several ski areas, dozens of lakes and rivers and a plethora of spectacular skate parks.

This business comes with 31 total trucks. A more detailed list of the trucks will be listed below in the ad. The current owner has owned this for 3.5 years and has worked extremely hard to get it to where it is now but has now decided to sell due to a real estate investment development deal opportunity that came up and needs the cash out of the business to move forward with it. Also the current owner has a wife and 8 month old baby at home and would like to spend more time at home with family. This business is truly turnkey with 2 solid managers in place with no plans on leaving, a full time mechanic (which it is very hard to find a good one), and staffing/drivers are where they need to be. Once a perspective buyer fills out NDA form and can show proof of being able to get the funds the perspective buyer can come in and do the due diligence to confirm all of this. The current owner is known as one of the best contractors to work for so as long as the new owner keeps this up staffing will not be an issue. Where the current owner has big advantages over other contractors in the building are two main things. 1. This is a larger service area and bigger than most meaning you have more cash flow over all to be able to keep things healthy and making money etc. 2. A huge advantage is this contract they go the furthest in the building meaning get paid the most in the building so as long as you know how to stay staffed you can always offer help to local contractors and make the current owners rates delivering local stops. Definitely a way to bring in extra profit. New owner just wants to ensure a smooth transition and the buyer to be very confident in what they are buying.

It features these healthy profit margins due to low product sourcing costs, high volume niche (beauty is consumable!) and no overhead like employees/staff (none), office (none), warehouse (none) as an online business model selling on Amazon platform where Amazon takes care of all the above.Detailed month-by-month financials and other business details will be sent to you as preliminary materials upon initial contact. However, upon contacting me (I am the direct owner) please confirm you are a cash buyer with liquid funds (as I don't offer owners financing or SBA).The business is an artfully-branded e-Commerce Amazon business that operates its own premium, private label brands only - it's not a regular retail store where you resell other people's brands - here you have your own so you control all the elements.The business comes with a fully polished and well positioned for scale Amazon online front end in a highly sought-after, high-volumne beauty category.It's a 100% drop-ship model where Amazon does everything - all logistics, with no overhead & no need for in-house employees.FBA based (Amazon stores & ships inventory to customers), all is outsourced to Amazon so the business can be operated from anywhere or while on the go and while travelling.Overall it's a turn-key business model with solid, well-laid, automated foundation, ready to scale or maintain for passive cash flow. It's for sale directly by owner.To receive more information and details just send me a message via BizQuest, confirm if a) you are a cash buyer (or if you would rely on loans to acquire) and b) if you are looking to acquire the business now or next months and c) what is your current line/area of business? >and let's get the conversation started.Thank you and I look forward to connecting.",https://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/99-passive-luxury-amazon-business-high-profit-margins-remote-online/2119619/?d=undefined,0,"Key perk: no employees, no staff, no office!

So no need to re-order anything anytime soon - no headache for a new owner and ease of management in the business.

The core of the business is an Amazon online store, selling only on Amazon.com in the US and featuring 3 main products (the new owner can add many more from supplier's catalog to scale earnings), in a lifestyle niche focusing on female customers.It sells female oriented accessories but anyone can run it, including men since all products have long been chosen (only best sellers on Amazon) and created (this business sells only own branded products - so you remain in full control - it's not a reseller of other people's brands - here you will own and sell your own brand, all with Amazon automated online system that's already set up, running, cash-flowing and long established).This passive business is almost 100% automated. Amazon stores the products and handles all order fulfilment. Products are stocked for the next 2 years so the new owner will not even have to replenish the stock anytime soon with the supplier. In 2 years time, you simply place a new order with the supplier and they ship directly to Amazon (this, inventory replenishment, is the main non passive part of the business).The business requires minimal time commitment, typically a few hours a week or month at most. Unless you want to scale it up - the business comes with a growth plan - you will see it as soon as you receive Prospectus Brief from me as it has dedicated section to growth items that are easy to implement and can scale the business even more.If you're interested in learning more, please contact me and let me know if a) you are a cash buyer with liquid funds (or if you would need a loan to acquire) b) are you looking to acquire the right business now or in the next months only, c) what is your current line of business/work?

Established Award Winning Whiskey Distillery Seeks Co-Owner or Buyer,"Golden, CO","$10,500,000",N/A,"$2,400,000",N/A,2008,N/A,N/A,"Golden Moon Distillery is an award-winning producer of whiskies and other spirits.The company currently produces a variety of products under the Golden Moon, Gun Fighter, and Olde Blackhawk brands.  These products are currently distributed in 14 US state markets, Canada, The UK, the EU and Taiwan.The Golden Moon brand consists of a family of award-winning American Single Malt Whiskies, and other spirits.  The Gun Fighter brand consists of a family of bourbons, ryes and premium American whiskey blends all bottled at 50% ABV.The Olde Blackhawk brand consists of a bourbon, a rye and a gin. These are currently only sold in Germany and Italy. AMERICAN SINGLE MALT WHISKEYGolden Moon Distillery’s plans for growth are currently focused on the growth and expansion of the American Single Malt category.  Golden Moon Distillery was one of the first of the craft distilleries in the US to embrace American Single Malt Whiskey.  We were also one of the early members of the American Single Malt Whiskey Commission, and have been very involved with the creation of the draft standard of identities put forth to the TTB.With the growth of the category and imminent release of a standard of identity by the TTB, we believe that Golden Moon Distillery presents an amazing opportunity for investors.  Investors would gain both a highly respected craft brand of American Single Malt and a small but world class production facility that has been built to be easily scalable.Our plant currently has 14,000 sq ft of production space.  This includes a ½ ton two-still whiskey production setup and a new bottling line.  More importantly, it also includes plumbing, boiler capacity and etc. to allow us to scale to up to 3 ½ tons of production capacity very easily. The plumbing and infrastructure is already in place.It should also be noted that all of our major-market single malt products have won Gold or Double Gold at the World Spirits Competition in San Francisco.Golden Moon Distillery has also won numerous other awards, including being named Distillery of The Year in 2019 by the American Distilling Institute, and as the Best Colorado Distillery three times.  As such Golden Moon has a stature and reputation that far exceeds our size.Lastly, related to our American Single Malts, one of the things that sets us apart from many of the other players in the category is our location.  Being located in the Rocky Mountains gives us distinct advantages.  First, the environment we’re in, including the altitude and humidity improves maturation.  Next, we source our malt from Molson Coors’ malt-house.  This gives us a significant logistical advantage and provides us with a consistent source for high quality malted barley.  Next, we use Rocky Mountain water from the Clear Creek and Montezuma watersheds of Colorado’s Rocky Mountains.  Then there’s Colorado’s reputation for producing great whiskies and spirits, which continues to grow.INNOVATIONGolden Moon Distillery is an innovation center of excellence.   Golden Moon has both the ability to do world-class innovation and a global reputation as a craft-producer that far outweighs our size.We have developed dozens of gins, liquors, liqueurs, absinthes, amaros, bitters, shochus and sojus for ourselves and other companies in the industry. Many of these have won major awards.  The same is true of our ability to develop and prototype unique whiskies as well.  Recent examples, include both; 1) Selling intellectual capital that we developed to Campari, and 2) Supporting the development and prototyping for the initial family of whiskies for Church of Oak in Ireland, a well-funded start-up backed by Bono.  Mr. Gould also acted as a consulting master distiller for them for over 2 ½ years.  We believe that the combination of our developed and award-winning products, our world-class production facility, our focus on American Single Malt Whiskey and our ability to innovate present a unique opportunity for investors.",https://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/established-award-winning-whiskey-distillery-seeks-co-owner-or-buyer/2116895/?d=undefined,Leased,"14,000",6/30/2028,12,"- A 14,000 sq ft world class production facility that has been built to be scalable, with infrastructure in place to scale production dramatically, simply by adding ""plug and play"" equipment.

We have retired so many people out of this industry (with 1 million to 3 million dollars in their pocket) we can’t even count them - and it might as well be you too.  This is an industry that is highly sought after, recession resistant, Covid resistant and its GROWING massively every year! In fact, the industry can’t even handle the client needs now!!  Further, this company has been on a 4 year upward trend in SALES! 2022 was the firm’s largest year in sales and as of the YTD through May 2023, it looks like the company will do about $3,100,000 with cash flow/earnings of $377,000 by the end of the year (straight-line projections)!!  If we were to comment on this location (we’re specialists in this industry) as far as profitability it would be this…the company is only dropping about 12% of sales to earnings and we consider anything under 18%, underperforming.  We have sold and ARE selling so many locations where the earnings are running 20% to 30% that we consider a really well performing company hitting about 23% to 25%.  If you were to take even last year’s sales of $2,853,266 x 23% you’d be sitting on $656k in earnings or about $338k more than what they did in 2022!!! Do that for a couple of years and turn around and sell this company for a hefty profit. When you get the details on this company make sure you ask for the “thought experiment” document and you can see how these numbers run out.

As long as it has available inventory, products sell out.The business had a very consistent sales since the start (month by month financials since inception available after contact is made).Average anywhere between 60%-75% profit margin on each product.Revenue in 2023 is looking even stronger than 2022.Importantly, this Amazon business sells only it's own dozen of unique brands and products - only my own products and designs - Not a reseller of other people's brands. This is important because only in this way you'll be in full control of everything: the look, the prices, the offer, the supplies.I offer 1 full month of full support and training post sale - however, since the business is nearly on autopilot (taking current owner around 1-2 hours per week to manage) you will need around 2-3 zoom sessions at max to feel everything out and see around and get familiar with Amazon dashboard (nevertheless full 1 month is offered to ensure your comfort and success).Everything is run by ""Fulfillment by Amazon"" model so stored, shipped and done by Amazon warehouses itself - that's why it's hands free. Now, more than ever, people are looking for something to allow them to work from home. As we know, more brick and mortar stores are closing all the time, and more and more online businesses are booming (customers choose convenience of buying online) This is expected to keep increasing at an alarming rate through 2030 and beyond --and there's no end in sight to this increasing profitable business of selling on Amazon specifically, as it's the most reputable and popular platform (and growing) - so the right industry to enter and profit from.One key perk: there is enough inventory already bough for the next couple of years of sales (over $100k in stock) that you will get as one of the assets with this business - in practice it means your recoupments and profits start right away from day 1 of ownership (because you would not need to invest anything in inventory or anything else for the next couple of years) - less headache and work for you, everything even more passive and streamlined.There is no owner's financing offered or SBA so it's only available for cash buyers with liquid funds.Feel free to reach out (please confirm that you're a cash buyer when doing so) and I will send you all detailed info on the business just next.",https://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/100-online-amazon-business-doing-over-700k-a-year-home-based/2085430/?d=undefined,0,"It's a perfect business for someone who wants to stay at home and work on their laptop or phone or someone who wants something 100% relocatable, travel-friendly and flexible in every way.

Only needs to be transferred to new owners. In order to be able to acquire this business through financing, you will need to have $30,000 cash on hand to put down. The rest of it will be financed through your credit card. You are required to have at least $20,000 monthly credit card limit to be eligible as well. The business comes with a support chat, in which all of the staff is communicating with each other on a daily basis. You can ask questions in there at any time of the day. It also comes with a live reporting spreadsheet, so you are always up to date on sales, profits, profit margins, expenses, etc. on your mobile or desktop device, no matter where you are. We have deals with a network of warehouses around the country. We use these warehouses to import products, repackage them to make them FBA compliant, and then they are sold on Amazon and Facebook Marketplace. We also have a team of 3 offices that do product research day in and day out, to make sure we are only selecting products which sell very well. The particular store we are referring to is generating about $17,000 a month in gross sales, meaning it's generating annual gross sales of $204,000. 20% of that is gross profit, meaning it is generating $40,800 in gross profit annually. 40% of that gross profit is net after expenses, meaning $16,320 is net profit in the owner's pocket annually. This is a great buy and once in a lifetime opportunity for the next buyer, since it means you can passively break even in less than 2 years! Then everything after that could be green. We have research facilities which find the best selling products online through a combination manual labor and software, we find the suppliers, we list those products, handle logistics through the warehouses, and profit!

Profitable Semi-Absentee Owned SaaS Company,"Grand Prairie, TX",N/A,"$218,446","$897,070","$143,446",1999,N/A,"$25,500","We are pleased to announce the availability for sale of this 24 year-old semi-absentee operated, consistently profitable SaaS (software as a service) Company, which focuses on the legal case management space. This company has returned 20%+ of its revenues as cash flow over the past four years and has consistently generated over $200K in cash flow on revenues of $850K-900K and features 85%-90% in recurring revenues across its long standing and loyal customer base. Due to increased business at two of its largest clients, through June of 2023, the company has generated revenues of $557K and cash flow of $173K, which suggests a $1.2M revenue run rate and SDE in excess of $350K. Its owner has had chronic health issues and has been forced to run the company as an absentee owner, investing only about 20 hours per week in the company, over the past several years. This company is positioned within the e-Discovery Consulting Services space in the US. This industry provides e-discovery services, usually for software and systems integration, that search, locate and secure data to use as evidence in court. Industry operators provide e-discovery consulting services, including collecting, processing and reviewing data, to end users like law firms, corporations, hospitals and government agencies. This industry excludes e-discovery software publishing, although some consulting firms may also develop their own software.(IBISWorld).This company boasts long term customer relationships, with high retention rates, a highly talented and well tenured employee pool.  Our analogy of this company is that it is a high performance Indy Car, which has been running on idle for the past few years, and it is simply waiting on a new driver (owner) to reach its potential. The fact that this company has used a work-from-home model, for 100% of its employees, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests that it can be operated from anywhere in the world as it does not occupy any corporate facilities and that all of its employees work from home, which provides the buyer with maximum operational flexibility.We believe that the possibilities for this company are almost endless and that it could grow considerably with adequate investment levels of advertising and sales as it has spent less than $3,000 on advertising in the past two years and it has no sales persons. The owner is committed to provide whatever level of training and transitional support to the buyer and for a mutually agreeable duration. No list price is provided as this company will be sold to the highest bidder and multiples for SaaS companies can vary widely based on a particular buyer and its fit for that buyer's purposes. According to reputable third party sources, SaaS businesses are generally valued on a multiple of their revenue - in most cases, the projected revenue for the next 12 months. Revenue multiples are a shorthand valuation framework. Given that most software companies are not profitable, or not generating meaningful FCF (Free Cash Flow), it’s the only metric to compare the entire industry against. Even a DCF (discounted cash flow) is riddled with long term assumptions. The promise of SaaS is that growth in the early years leads to profits in the mature years.",https://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/profitable-semi-absentee-owned-saas-company/2109760/?d=undefined,7,Included in asking price,Home based.

Period. What was primarily a Landscape and Masonry Company for its first 30 years has turned into an elite design and build firm with repeat clientele at a very high level from North Orange County, through the Westside and Bel Air/BH, and out to Santa Barbara. 50-60 percent of the work is in L.A. Beverly Hills, Palos Verdes, Pasadena, Encino, Calabasas, Westlake Village, etc. There is a professional marketing company on a monthly retainer creating leads of all kinds from small patio type jobs to huge pool installs. No single client accounts for more than 3 percent of the company revenue. Probably THE largest asset of this firm is it’s exclusive relationship with the largest retailer of plants, pots, and home furnishings in the USA. 23 contractors in the entire USA are fortunate enough to be Partners with this retailer. The client comes into the store and talks about home furnishings, plants, design, etc. and the retail store sells them plants and soil for example. At the time of the sale they are given this company’s name as the exclusive installer for their area. The retailer gives the company the customer name and email and you call and introduce yourself as the vetted installer for said retailer. This contract in and of itself has to be valued at half $1 million as they generate 300,000 to 500,000 in revenue for the company each and every year. Some years the firm utilizes them less because their own book of business is just so large and constant. In slower times like the pandemic times this firm generated the same exact revenue as it always has which not many companies can say. The owner would rather have a partner than sell this business. If a buyer wants to buy the business and not be partners with the current owner that’s available as an option however the down payment is not negotiable. The remaining amount the owner is so confident in his business he will finance over 3 to 5 years at a little very low percentage 4 to 5%. Another huge plus is the marketing company can tailor the marketing each week according to the jobs in progress or where the new owner would like to work. For example if there is a big job in Encino and you want to target in Sino Tarzana Sherman Oaks during the time the cruise are at the Encino job the marketing company does that incredibly well. Now you have three jobs within 15 to 20 minutes of each other and that’s how money is made in this business. I repeat this business cannot be duplicated without many years of hard work meaning decades. There are trucks, tools, machinery, three different service yards to make getting to jobs easier and storing materials more convenient. Nothing hasn’t been thought of over the years and planned systematically. Do yourself a favor and at least check this business out. Again the owner is so confident he wants to stay as opposed to sell completely but will sell if that’s what a buyer wants. Must understand construction on some level. 3 different Contractors Licenses and one Government License held by the owner of this business.

Great profits, and very little work required. The Painting industry is huge. People are always looking to paint and freshen up rooms in their homes with fresh paint. This also applies to larger commercial work as well. The potential is unlimited.  I spend about 1 hour a week working this business right now. The business gets about 20+ quality leads per month. This number is growing each month, and I expect that to get increasingly better in the months to come. Leads come in through our email form and direct phone calls. The business website has been highly optimized with expert level Search Engine Optimization. It currently ranks #1 for multiple keywords, and is on the first page of Google! I have not spent a penny on advertising since starting this business. All leads come in organically. The website is very informative, with good navigation, gallery, inquiry form fields, etc. All of the leads I get go to a few subcontractors that I know do very good work, and I collect a percentage of each job, so I don’t do any of the work. It’s all sub-contracted. This is a great work-from-home business too. You can run the business the way I’m running it and make a very nice passive income, or if you already have a painting business, and want to add significant revenue to your business, the return on your investment would be very quick. The business has generated over $172,000 in jobs in the past 12 months and is growing rapidly. This business generates a very good profit for me without doing any actual work. I have five other businesses that pretty much take up all of my time, and I don’t have the extra time to give this one the attention that it deserves. This is a tremendous opportunity for someone who wants a profitable business that you can run on the side as passive income spending 1-2 hours a week following up and coordinating leads with the subcontractors so they can quote the work.   This is a low cost established business that is priced right and experiencing unparalleled growth! No previous experienced necessary! I will work with the new buyer to teach them the business and train them on the process that I have developed that will continue to make them more money. I can also show the new owner a few easy and very low to no cost ways to get even more leads, and close even more business. I just don’t have the time to follow up on all the leads, and help close business. I still have several leads from a couple months ago that I haven’t been able to call back or follow up. Just a few of the many advantages of this business include:     -	ALL Cash Business-	M-F Hours. No Nights or weekends-	Website for the business is Search Engine Optimized and ranks on the first page of Google-	All leads come in organically, and you don’t have to pay a penny in marketing or advertising-	Great Return on Investment (ROI) – You could get your investment back in probably 18 to 24 months.

The business has seen consistent growth and profitability over the past 5 years and remained consistent and profitable during the COVID pandemic. The company is well staffed with highly skilled employees including multiple P.E. and P.S. licensed professionals to provide the range of services and expertise required for the wide variety of public and private civil engineering projects completed by the firm. COVID-19 Impact Statement: The business operated as an essential business throughout COVID-19.  Sales and profitability remained consistently strong.

Inventory and WIP: Inventory is included in the asking price but is nominal and includes primarily office and miscellaneous supplies.

The seller’s preference is to retain ownership of the real estate and execute a new lease on similar terms to the current lease arrangement with a buyer.  The leased space is approximately 3,000 SF of office and storage space. Growth and Expansion: The business is an excellent strategic acquisition opportunity for an existing company looking to expand into a new geographic territory or to grow their presence in the current market.

The business is driven primarily by word of mouth, referral, and repeat business creating ample growth opportunity for someone to develop and implement a strategic marketing plan. Adding more staff or acquiring and merging with another smaller firm would increase the capacity to take on more work, realize better economies of scale, and improve operational efficient, while reducing overhead costs associated with operating a small, professional firm.Reason for Selling:  The owner is selling to retire from the field and pursue interests in other industries while spending more time with family.

VirtuRide Cycling Studio For Sale / Investor Opportunity,"North Miami Beach, FL","$200,000","$120,000","$350,000","$75,000",2015,Included in asking price,"$150,000","VirtuRide® - Best Ride Ever® is looking for a new location!The current location will be knocked down and we must move the studio somewhere else.We are currently in a faraway warehouse, we built the brand here, created the concept, registered the patents, proved the concept, and now it’s time to move to a high traffic location (preferably underneath a condominium building with lots of young people).Since we opened, we've learned that that most important factor in our business is proximity to our clients. Therefor we are not looking for another commercial warehouse, but a location that is in a high traffic area. We offer 2 ways of investment: 1. You can buy our equipment and relocate the studio wherever you want, and we will assist you in training / running / managing it if you choose to.2. We keep the equipment under our ownership, you don’t need to pay us anything for it, you will be responsible for funding the: Relocation, New Location build up and the rent for 3 years, and we will split the income %50/%50. We bring the equipment and know-how, and you bring the funds to relocate and rent for 3 years, so we can focus on running it without the stress of rent. Why invest in VirtuRide? 1. One-Of-A-Kind Technology, Entertainment and Fitness, combined: Our bikes are not like any other spin studio. The bikes in our studio move on the road! Yes! Up, down and to the sides! And we own the patents and the trademarks for it. You will benefit from using the rights to it. We created Motion Platforms that clip under each bike and moves each bike: up down and to the sides, according to a road movie that is projected on a mega screen.2. We filmed over 50 full length road videos, curated with the best playlists, and aligned with instructors’ choreography that makes each class an incredible experience. You will benefit from the last 7 years of movie production that are completed already. The movies we filmed are the heart of the business. We invested a tremendous amount of money and time into filming, editing, and producing these movies. You will benefit from it as well. 3. The reviews say it all. Read the reviews on Google and on TrustPilot.com and you'll see what people say about us. If we're so successful, why do we need an investor / partner? We invested all the profits in making more movies, in manufacturing more motion platforms, in registering all the patents and trademarks. We invested in Franchise Disclosure Documents and Manual OF Operation. Now, we need to move from our current location as the landlord will demolish the warehouse we are in, and we cannot afford rebuilding the business somewhere else.So, we are looking for an investor / silent partner that will buy the equipment from us and with our guidance will reopen somewhere else, OR - go into a partnership with us, where you take care of the relocation and rent for 3 years, and we bring the equipment and know how.But - No Matter what, the relocation MUST be to a high traffic place, otherwise there is no point in doing this. We don’t need a fancy place, it can be a dark room at the bottom of a condo building, but we do need a central location, walking distance to our clients (mostly women 20-65y.o). VirtuRide is an INCREDIBLE Fitness experience.

99% Automated Amazon Store. No Employees. Location-Free. Autopilot.,"Nashville, TN","$1,550,000",N/A,"$704,987",N/A,2020,Included in asking price,N/A,"Average anywhere between 70% profit margin on each product, some products higher (after all fees). Simplified business model (Amazon FBA where Amazon stores, ships, sells, does customer service - the owner only needs to communicate with the supplier to send enough products to Amazon FBA directly so there is always stock Amazon can sell).For 2022 alone the business has done over $700k in sales. As long as it has available inventory, products sell out and operations are automated and done by Amazon itself.The business had a very consistent sales since the start (month by month financials since inception available after contact is made).Importantly, this Amazon business sells only it's own dozen of unique brands and products - only my own products and designs - Not a reseller of other people's brands. This is important because only in this way you'll be in full control of everything: the look, the prices, the offer, the supplies.I offer 1 full month of full support and training post sale - however, since the business is nearly on autopilot (taking current owner around 1-2 hours per week to manage) you will need around 2-3 zoom sessions at max to feel everything out and see around and get familiar with Amazon dashboard (nevertheless full 1 month is offered to ensure your comfort and success).Everything is run by ""Fulfillment by Amazon"" model so stored, shipped and done by Amazon warehouses itself - that's why it's hands free.Now, more than ever, people are looking for something to allow them to work from home. As we know, more brick and mortar stores are closing all the time, and more and more online businesses are booming (customers choose convenience of buying online) This is expected to keep increasing at an alarming rate through 2030 and beyond --and there's no end in sight to this increasing profitable business of selling on Amazon specifically, as it's the most reputable and popular platform (and growing) - so the right industry to enter and profit from.One key perk: there is enough inventory already bough for the next couple of years of sales (over 100k in stock) that you will get as one of the assets with this business - in practice it means your recoupments and profits start right away from day 1 of ownership (because you would not need to invest anything in inventory or anything else for the next couple of years) - less headache and work for you, everything even more passive and streamlined.There is no owner's financing offered or SBA so it's only available for cash buyers with liquid funds.Feel free to reach out (please confirm that you're a cash buyer when doing so) and I will send you all detailed info on the business just next.",https://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/99-automated-amazon-store-no-employees-location-free-autopilot/2086105/?d=undefined,0,"It's a perfect business for someone who wants to stay at home and work on their laptop or phone or someone who wants something 100% relocatable, travel-friendly and flexible in every way.

No need for employees, staff or physical location in this model - all is done online, which means just less headaches than a traditional brick and mortar business.

The new owner will get over 100k in stock already bought (no inventory headache or need to replenish for the next couple of years) -big advantage. (Home Based)",eCommerce in general and Amazon marketplace in particular are on an upward trajectory so it's a business area of the future where it's best to enter earlier than later to reap first-movers advantages.,Can be scaled by the new owner by simply utilizing Amazon ads option (you can just hire Amazon ads agency to run Amazon ads for you - I will point you to many of them during training month together) - this is a simple way to amplify earnings and scale up fast with hands free approach.,Liquid funds/cash acquisition only. No owner financing or SBA loans avail,1 full month of in-depth support & training (if wanted) provided to the new owner (in reality you would need closer to 3 days to grasp the concept since the business is turn-key and mainly on autopilot now),This business is Home-Based

Indian Restaurant - 5 min walk from America's 3rd largest campus,"Columbus, OH","$139,999",N/A,N/A,N/A,2001,N/A,N/A,"Restaurant has been managed for past 22 years by a mom & pop owner. Now they are ready to retire. With new ownership, this location has the potential to become an iconic restaurant brand known throughout Columbus, and especially with Ohio State students and recent grads. Includes beer license. Build a dine-in, take out, and DELIVERY brand that is a 5 minute walk to the 3rd largest university in America by enrollment. You are also situated within the heart of where many alumni move after graduation, allowing you to build brand loyalty within a 3-5 mile radius, while also being in the center of Columbus, in a extremally high trafficked corner location on HIGH STREET. The restaurant has 1 year left on a very low-priced 3-year lease for the area.Being slightly off campus provides a win-win strategy. The prime location allows you to capture the 70k+ students and workers going to Ohio State, but you are far away enough where your rent is a fraction of on-campus real estate. Additionally, being around more residential areas allows you to capture non-student sales for when school is on break. Being a 5 minute walk from campus also allows you to take full advantage of large events at Ohio Stadium and Schottenstein Center, without being consumed by the traffic & chaos of those events.  You are also within delivery distance of some of the most densely populated locations in Columbus, and these have younger populations who are much more likely to use services such as Doordash. For the right owner, with the right branding & marketing, this could be a iconic restaurant with a large but loyal customer base that ages around the restaurant's neighborhood. The word of mouth potential and direct marketing potential from such a prime location is hard to put a value on. Due to the owners wanting to retire, you are able to buy into this location at a excellent price point.The sale includes the transfer of real estate lease. It also includes all equipment, dishes, inventory, and fixtures at the restaurant.
